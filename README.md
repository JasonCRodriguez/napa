# New American Publc Art: Color Commons

## Background
Color commons is an interactive public art exhibit.  It consists of several color towers that change color based on user text messages.

## Notes from Bevan

The pertinent data we receive (from our Twilio server) is:

    From : [ the phone number of the person sending the color ]
    Body : [ the color sent ] 
    SentDate : [ sent date ] 

Some of the trends we'd like to interpret are:

    Total amount of texts []
    Top 5 Colors
    How many times “secret” was texted
    Peak use times of day / week 
    Unique users 
    Repeat users 
    Highly engaged users (over 15 texts)
    Clustering - are there clusters of numbers that occur within temporal proximity
    any other trends you think would be interesting!
